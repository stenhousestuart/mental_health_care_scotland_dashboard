## Introduction

This project is made up of an interactive dashboard supporting basic exploratory analysis of data relating to mental health care in Scotland.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Aim/Purpose

The app has been created for learning purposes only. I developed the initial version during my free time while completing the CodeClan Professional Data Analysis Course. It serves as a tool for personal development and to demonstrate relevant data analysis skills.
